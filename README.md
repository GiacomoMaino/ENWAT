# ENWAT

It's a web app born to keep the memories of my highschool class all in the same place.
The current web-app is only accessible to the account registered, which are one for each of the members of the class.

## Technology
For this project I used Firebase for the back-end and React for the front-end.

## Developing time
E.N.W.A.T. is the result of one week of hard work for its main functionalities, while for the style it has actully been restyled as of version 0.0.2 and that took a couple of days.

## Meaning
E.N.W.A.T. stands for "Even Now We Are Togheter", I took inspiration for the name from E.D.I.T.H, the glasses of Tony Stark.
